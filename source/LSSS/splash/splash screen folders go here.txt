
	NOTE:
Put your splash screens in their respective folders inside this directory. ( 0:/LSSS/splash/your-splash-screen-here/ )
If you have a splash screen named "config", you should rename it, as "config" is reserved for splash screen configurations.
Thank you for using LSSS! I've gotten word that someone is working on a standalone Arm11 splash screen switcher (completely unrelated to both me and LSSS), so look forward to that!
